# TenazAyuda

TenazAyuda is an open-source, free to use, robotic arm designed for people with low or null mobility to allow them to be much more autonomous and independent by accomplishing different daily tasks alone, like drinking, eating and manipulating objects and improve their quality of life. Moreover, with TenazAyuda one can interact more fluently with ones family causing a great enrichment of ones self-respect.

It is configured by default to carry two stepper motors and four servos in order to give the user five degrees of freedom, but all of these could easily be changed. An Arduino Mega was used to control them, while a Funduino Joystick served as the user interface.

[Atom Platformio] is recommended as the programming IDE to be used. Inside de `docs` folder, a PDF file can be found with the corresponding documentation (in spanish) to be able to build the whole robotic arm.
